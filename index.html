  <p>I have been a resident of Colorado for 12 years now. Moved from Minneapolis, MN to go to college in Boulder at CU and earned a degree in 
      Environmental Science. However, by then I was consumed by my passion for music and current band, so I pursued that industry where I work to this day.
      I also put on music events across the country, including music and camping festivals. I love my job and my dog. Looking to expand my horizons though. Nice to meet you.
